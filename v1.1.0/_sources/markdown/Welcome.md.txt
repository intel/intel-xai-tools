# Intel® Explainable AI Tools

This repository provides tools for data scientists and MLOps engineers that have requirements specific to AI model interpretability.

## Overview

The Intel Explainable AI Tools are designed to help users detect and mitigate against issues of fairness and interpretability, while running best on Intel hardware.
There are two Python* components in the repository:

* [Model Card Generator](model_card_gen)
  * Creates interactive HTML reports containing model performance and fairness metrics
* [Explainer](explainer)
  * Runs post-hoc model distillation and visualization methods to examine predictive behavior for both TensorFlow* and PyTorch* models via a simple Python API including the following modules:
    * [Attributions](plugins/explainers/attributions): Visualize negative and positive attributions of tabular features, pixels, and word tokens for predictions
    * [CAM (Class Activation Mapping)](plugins/explainers/cam-pytorch): Create heatmaps for CNN image classifications using gradient-weight class activation CAM mapping
    * [Metrics](plugins/explainers/metrics): Gain insight into models with the measurements and visualizations needed during the machine learning workflow

## Get Started

### Requirements
* Linux system or WSL2 on Windows (validated on Ubuntu* 20.04/22.04 LTS)
* Python 3.9, 3.10
* Install required OS packages with `apt-get install build-essential python3-dev`
* git (only required for the "Developer Installation")
* Poetry

### Developer Installation with Poetry

Use these instructions to install the Intel AI Safety python library with a clone of the
GitHub repository. This can be done instead of the basic pip install, if you plan
on making code changes.

1. Clone this repo and navigate to the repo directory.

2. Allow poetry to create virtual envionment contained in `.venv` directory of current directory. 

   ```bash
   poetry lock
   ```
   In addtion, you can explicitly tell poetry which python instance to use
   
   ```bash
   poetry env use /full/path/to/python
   ```

3. Choose the `intel_ai_safety` subpackages and plugins that you wish to install.
   
   a. Install `intel_ai_safety` with all of its subpackages (e.g. `explainer` and `model_card_gen`) and plugins
   ```bash
   poetry install --extras all
   ```

   b. Install `intel_ai_safety` with just `explainer`
   ```bash
   poetry install --extras explainer
   ```
   
   c. Install `intel_ai_safety` with just `model_card_gen`
   ```bash
   poetry install --extras model-card
   ```
   
   d. Install `intel_ai_safety` with `explainer` and all of its plugins
   ```bash
   poetry install --extras explainer-all
   ```

   e. Install `intel_ai_safety` with `explainer` and just its pytorch implementations
   
   ```bash
   poetry install --extras explainer-pytorch
   ```
   
   f. Install `intel_ai_safety` with `explainer` and just its tensroflow implementations
   
   ```bash
   poetry install --extras explainer-tensorflow
   ``` 

4. Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

### Install to existing enviornment with Poetry

#### Create and activate a Python3 virtual environment
We encourage you to use a python virtual environment (virtualenv or conda) for consistent package management.
There are two ways to do this:
1. Choose a virtual enviornment to use:
   a. Using `virtualenv`:
      ```bash
      python3 -m virtualenv xai_env
      source xai_env/bin/activate
      ```

   b. Or `conda`:
      ```bash
      conda create --name xai_env python=3.9
      conda activate xai_env
      ```
2. Install to current enviornment
   ```bash
   poetry config virtualenvs.create false && poetry install --extras all
   ```

### Additional Feature-Specific Steps
Notebooks may require additional dependencies listed in their associated documentation.

### Verify Installation

Verify that your installation was successful by using the following commands, which display the Explainer and Model Card Generator versions:
```bash
python -c "from intel_ai_safety.explainer import version; print(version.__version__)"
python -c "from intel_ai_safety.model_card_gen import version; print(version.__version__)"
```

## Running Notebooks
